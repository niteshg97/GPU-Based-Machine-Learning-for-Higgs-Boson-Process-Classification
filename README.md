# GPU-Based-Machine-Learning-for-Higgs-Boson-Process-Classification
This notebook contains the implementation of a GPU-based machine learning technique for discriminating between a signal process that produces Higgs bosons and a background process that does not. The proposed machine learning technique utilises the RAPIDS framework for parallel processing.
